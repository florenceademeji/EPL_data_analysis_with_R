#  Analyzing English Premier League Standings

A Comprehensive R Function for Dynamic Match Data Processing

## Background
The English Premier League (EPL) stands as a premier football league globally, boasting 20 competitive teams. Each team competes in 38 matches from August through May, totaling 380 matches per season. In the EPL, victory earns a team 3 points, a draw 1 point, and a loss none. This project aims to develop a function in R to retrieve, process, and analyze match data dynamically, generating updated league standings for a specified date and season.

## Executive Summary
This project revolves around creating a custom R function called EPL_Standings, tailored to produce league standings based on input parameters for date and season. The function accurately manages data inconsistencies, performing comprehensive data cleaning, transformation, aggregation, and sorting to present an accurate summary of team performances up to the chosen date. The analysis focuses on data from the latest three EPL seasons.

## Goals of Analysis
  ##### • Create the EPL_Standings Function: Retrieve EPL match data from online resources.
  ##### • Process Match Data: Compute crucial statistics for each team.
  ##### • Display Updated Standings: Rank teams by points per match and additional tie-breaking metrics.
  ##### • Ensure Data Accuracy: Efficiently handle data from the most recent three EPL seasons.

## Methodology
##### •Data Retrieval: The function extracts EPL match results for the given season from web sources. It covers the three most recent seasons:   2021/22, 2022/23, and 2023/24.
##### •Data Cleaning: Standardizes date formats and column names across different seasons for consistency.
##### • Data Transformation: Filters data to include only matches up to the specified date.
##### • Data Aggregation: Merges home and away match results, calculating wins, losses, draws, goals, points, and other relevant statistics.
##### • Data Sorting: Orders the final standings by points per match, wins, goals per match, and goals allowed per match.

## Key Insights
##### • Performance Metrics: The function calculates key metrics such as points per match, point percentage, goals scored per match, and goals allowed per match.
##### • Team Comparison: Provides detailed comparisons of team performances, offering clear standings based on multiple criteria.
##### • Dynamic Data Handling: The function can dynamically update standings with current season data as new matches occur.


## Recommendations
##### • Regular Data Validation: Continuously validate and clean the dataset to maintain accuracy.
##### • Expand Function Features: Incorporate additional features, such as multi-season trend analysis or player-specific performance metrics.
##### • Develop a User-Friendly Interface: Create an accessible interface for non-technical users to easily view and interpret league standings.
