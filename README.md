#  Analyzing English Premier League Standings

A Comprehensive R Function for Dynamic Match Data Processing

## Background
The English Premier League (EPL) stands as a premier football league globally, boasting 20 competitive teams. Each team competes in 38 matches from August through May, totaling 380 matches per season. In the EPL, victory earns a team 3 points, a draw 1 point, and a loss none. This project aims to develop a function in R to retrieve, process, and analyze match data dynamically, generating updated league standings for a specified date and season.

## Executive Summary
This project revolves around creating a custom R function called EPL_Standings, tailored to produce league standings based on input parameters for date and season. The function accurately manages data inconsistencies, performing comprehensive data cleaning, transformation, aggregation, and sorting to present an accurate summary of team performances up to the chosen date. The analysis focuses on data from the latest three EPL seasons.

## Goals of Analysis
  ##### • Create the EPL_Standings Function: Retrieve EPL match data from online resources.
  ##### • Process Match Data: Compute crucial statistics for each team.
  ##### • Display Updated Standings: Rank teams by points per match and additional tie-breaking metrics.
  ##### • Ensure Data Accuracy: Efficiently handle data from the most recent three EPL seasons.

## Methodology
##### •Data Retrieval: The function extracts EPL match results for the given season from web sources. It covers the three most recent seasons:   2021/22, 2022/23, and 2023/24.
##### •Data Cleaning: Standardizes date formats and column names across different seasons for consistency.
##### • Data Transformation: Filters data to include only matches up to the specified date.
##### • Data Aggregation: Merges home and away match results, calculating wins, losses, draws, goals, points, and other relevant statistics.
##### • Data Sorting: Orders the final standings by points per match, wins, goals per match, and goals allowed per match.


## Key Insights

1. **Top Performers**:
   - The top 5 teams based on Points Per Match (PPM) show the strongest performance in the league as of the selected date. These teams have consistently won more matches and accumulated more points.
   
2. **Struggling Teams**:
   - The bottom 5 teams based on Points Per Match (PPM) indicate those that are struggling the most in the league. They have fewer points and more losses compared to others.
   
3. **Goals Analysis**:
   - The average goals scored per match (GSM) and goals against per match (GAM) provide insight into the offensive and defensive capabilities of the teams. Higher GSM indicates strong offensive performance, while lower GAM indicates better defensive performance.

4. **Overall Performance**:
   - The summary statistics give a quick overview of the league's performance as a whole, highlighting the average points per match and goals statistics.


## Recommendations
**• For Top Performers:**

The top teams should continue to leverage their current strategies and maintain their momentum to ensure they remain at the top of the standings.

Focus on managing player injuries and maintaining fitness levels to sustain high performance throughout the season.

Improving defensive strategies could further increase their chances of winning even for high-performing teams.

**• For Struggling Teams:**

Evaluate and adjust tactical approaches to improve performance. This may involve changes in formation, player roles, or game strategies.

Teams with a high Goals Against per Match (GAM) should prioritize strengthening their defensive line to reduce the number of goals conceded.

Work on team morale and cohesion to foster a positive environment that encourages better performance on the field.

**• General Recommendations**

All teams should continually scout for new talent to address weaknesses and build a more competitive squad.

Utilize performance data to make informed decisions on player selection, training focus, and match tactics.

Ensure all players are at peak physical condition to reduce injuries and improve overall performance.

##### These recommendations aim to help teams optimize their performance and address key areas for improvement based on the analysis.
